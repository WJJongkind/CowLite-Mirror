# CowLite-Mirror
There is a lot of software that alllows you to mirror one folder to another folder. However, most of these programs don't support some of the most basic things: hiding the application to system tray, assigning a number of threads that the software may use, set the interval of file checks... CowLite Folder Mirror offers a great solution to the problems that are caused by already existing software.
